Converted code from VBForums [WinForms Bootstrap Theme](https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?873159-WinForms-Bootstrap-Theme) by [dday9](https://www.vbforums.com/member.php?134734-dday9)

This is a work in progress, but here is a library that I've been working on that mimics twitter-bootstrap 4.3.

**Control**
- Base Class
- Rounded edge control
- Function to calculate REM

**Alert**

- Dismissable - i.e. a close icon appears in the upper-right hand corner, once the close icon is clicked it destroys the control.
- Fadable - i.e. when the Dismiss method is called, it slowly causes the control to fade away.

**Button**

- IsOutline - Allows the button to just contain a border
- MouseOver, MouseEnter, and Disabled styles the button
