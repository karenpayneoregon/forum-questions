Converted code from VBForums [WinForms Bootstrap Theme](https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?873159-WinForms-Bootstrap-Theme) by [dday9](https://www.vbforums.com/member.php?134734-dday9)

This is a work in progress, but here is a library that I've been working on that mimics twitter-bootstrap 4.3.

:yellow_circle: Control
- [Base Class](https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/forum-questions/blob/master/CustomControlsBootStrapLibrary/Classes/Control.cs#L16)
- Rounded edge control
- Function to calculate REM

:yellow_circle: Alert

[Source](https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/forum-questions/blob/master/CustomControlsBootStrapLibrary/Classes/Control.cs#L124)

- `Dismissable` - i.e. a close icon appears in the upper-right hand corner, once the close icon is clicked it destroys the control.
- `Fadable` - i.e. when the Dismiss method is called, it slowly causes the control to fade away.

:yellow_circle: Button

[Source](https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/forum-questions/blob/master/CustomControlsBootStrapLibrary/Classes/Control.cs#L394)

- `IsOutline` - Allows the button to just contain a border
- `MouseOver`, `MouseEnter`, and Disabled styles the button
