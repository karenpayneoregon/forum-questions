Once this project is open in Visual Studio with .NET 5 installed, double click on the project 
node (the project name) in Visual Studio which open too.

Note if this was a console app remove the **-window** section from the TargetFramework node.


```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">


	<PropertyGroup>
		<OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
		<LangVersion>9.0</LangVersion>
		<TargetFramework>net5.0-windows</TargetFramework>
		<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>
	</PropertyGroup>


	<ItemGroup>
	  <PackageReference Include="System.Data.SqlClient" Version="4.8.2" />
	</ItemGroup>



</Project>
```

Note the `ItemGroup` section, this informs .NET that a package for `System.Data.SqlClient` is needed. When building this project Visual Studio should restore the package and if not
 right click on the project name in solution explorer, select `manage NuGet packages`, do a restore by pressing the restore button.

Or simply install via [instructions here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/).

Now build the project.
