# About

A common question in developer forums is how to create dynamic buttons without consideration for the Click event.

This project uses a custom button with several custom properties to assist with working with logic in the button click event like storing a primary key from a database table to retrieve data.

:yellow_circle:  `.NET Framework` is used and will work with `.NET Core Framework` too Only reason for not using .NET Core is this way both Frameworks can use this code.
